			There are a total of 108 cards in this deck. Seventy percent of the deck is made up of number
			cards from 0 to 9, with four colours including blue, green, red, and yellow. Each colour
			features 19 cards with one zero card and two of each other numbers in the deck. Action cards

			different sorts of action cards. Each color has two copies of each action card. These are the
			following:
			<div class="pl-5">
				<ul class="list-inside list-disc">
					<li>Skip card - the next player in the sequence misses a turn.</li>
					<li>Reverse - reverses the direction of play.</li>
					<li>Draw two - the next player draws two cards and misses one turn.</li>
				</ul>

				<ul class="list-inside list-disc">
					<li>Wild - lets the player choose what colour to play..</li>
					<li>
						Wild draw 4 - declare the next colour to match, and force the next player to draw four
						cards.
